"Goodall had always been drawn to animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957.[11] From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey,[12] the Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids,[13] was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his co-researcher and wife, British paleoanthropologist Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania), where he laid out his plans.[14]"
